of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

The scripts used to build this distribution are in:

- `distro-info/scripts`

## Deprecation notices

### 32-bit support

Support for 32-bit x86 GNU/Linux and x86 Windows was
dropped in 2022. Support for 32-bit Arm GNU/Linux (armv7l) will be preserved
for a while, due to the large user base of 32-bit Raspberry Pi systems.

### GNU/Linux minimum requirements

Support for RedHat 7 was dropped in 2022 and the
minimum requirement was raised to GLIBC 2.27, available starting
with Ubuntu 18, Debian 10 and RedHat 8.
